# Game of life
[Conway game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

## The rules of the game are  
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population. 

2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.

4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The beautiful thing about the game of life is that it actually isn't a game in the conventional sense. Once the pieces/ pattern is set the rules of the game takes over and would determine everything that happens.  In most cases, it is impossible to look at a starting position (or pattern) and see what will happen in the future. The only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.
